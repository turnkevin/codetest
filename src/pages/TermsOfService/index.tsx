        <h2>Changing Your Service Level</h2>
        <p>
          Some services provided by Techscrum.com allow you to upgrade or downgrade your service
          levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you upgrade your service level from one package to a higher priced package, the Company
          will charge you thus: If you pay monthly, your first payment will be the difference
          between the higher priced package and your current package price, whereby monies received
          by Company for your current package price is pro-rated based on the actual number of days
          until your scheduled monthly payment date. Your regularly scheduled monthly payment date
          will remain the same as your initial purchase date, with subsequent monthly charges at the
          higher package price.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you purchase or upgrade additional services that are charged on a monthly basis, your
          first payment for those additional services will be the price of the additional services
          pro-rated based on the actual number of days until your next monthly payment date. Your
          scheduled monthly payment date will remain the same as your initial purchase date, with
          the full price of the additional services reflected in subsequent monthly charges. If you
          purchase additional services that are charged on an annual basis, your first payment for
          those additional services will be the full price of the additional service. The renewal
          date for such annual additional services will be the date of upgrade the subsequent year.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are limited package downgrade options available and no refunds. Subscribers that
          wish to move from a higher priced package to a lower priced package must let the current
          service level expire then repurchase at the desired service level (or use the Free version
          if available).
