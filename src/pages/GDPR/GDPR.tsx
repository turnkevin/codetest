          <h2>What is the GDPR?</h2>
          <p>
            The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was introduced to harmonize data privacy
            laws across Europe, to protect the data privacy of all EU citizens’ data, and to shape
            the way organizations across the region approach data privacy. GDPR replaced the Data
            Protection Directive 95/46/EC and it came into force on May 25th, 2018. The full text of
            the GDPR can be found <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">here</a>.
            <br />
            <br />
            GDPR significantly increased the responsibilities for organizations and businesses in
            how they collect, use, and protect personal data. At the centre of the new law is the
            requirement for organizations and businesses to be fully transparent about how they are
            using and protecting personal data, and to be able to demonstrate accountability for
            their data processing activities.
          </p>

          <h2>Why we welcome GDPR at TechScrum</h2>
          <p>
            At TechScrum, we understand the importance of putting privacy and data protection in the
            hands of our customers, so we are fully in compliance with the GDPR. We have carefully
            examined the relevant provisions of the GDPR and we closely followed applicable GDPR
            guidance issued by regulatory authorities. The GDPR strengthens individuals’ privacy
            rights through tighter controls over the processing of their personal data, significant
            expansion of their rights over their data, and increased transparency into the nature,
            purpose, and use of it. In our eyes, GDPR is a good thing.
          </p>

          <h2>TechScrum &rsquo;s commitment to GDPR compliance</h2>
          <p>
            In preparation for GDPR, we formed a core team of leaders from each area of TechScrum
            business, coordinated by our internal Data Protection Officer (DPO). The representatives
            in this group were charged with ensuring that all the requirements of GDPR were
            addressed across all teams.
          </p>

          <h2>What steps did we take in preparation for GDPR?</h2>
          <h3>Data collection and processing audit</h3>
          <p>
            We reviewed all TechScrum activities and all of our product suite to identify where we
            are collecting and processing customer data. Based on this, we validated our legal basis
            for collecting and processing that personal data. We also ensured that we are applying
            the appropriate safeguards across our entire infrastructure (both hardware and software)
            to fully protect this data.
          </p>

          <h3>Third-party vendors audit</h3>
          <p>
            We completed an audit of all third party vendors and validated their GDPR compliance.
            All vendor agreements were in place by 25th May.
          </p>

          <h3>Updated Terms of Service and Privacy Policy</h3>
          <p>
            We have updated our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. These updated versions clearly
            outlined what personal data we’re collecting and processing, why, how we use it, who we
            share it with, and how long we store it for. As always, we aim to keep the language in
            our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy as clear as possible.
          </p>

          <h3>Data access, portability, and deletion</h3>
          <p>
            We know that you’ll want to provide the same level of GDPR compliance to your customers
            as we do to you. We made it easy to support your customers and give them the ability to
            access, handle, and delete their personal data. Because we operate on a self-service
            basis, you’ll always have full control over your own data, including autonomy in how you
            process your customers’ information. We also ensure that all of your data – and your
            customers’ data – is easily exportable in a commonly used and computer readable format.
          </p>

          <h3>Breach management</h3>
          <p>
            As part of our HIPAA compliance, we already have management and communication processes
            in place in the unlikely event of a data breach; we’ve updated these to further comply
            with the GDPR regulations.
          </p>

          <h3>We’re here to help</h3>
          <p>
            We know that navigating GDPR can seem daunting, but we’re here to help. If you have any
            questions or concerns regarding how we protect your personal data, please don’t hesitate
            to reach out to us at gdpr@techscrum.com.
