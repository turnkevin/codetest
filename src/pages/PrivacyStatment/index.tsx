          <h2>Security</h2>
          <p>
            We are committed to protecting the security of your personal data. We use a variety of
            security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal data from
            unauthorised access and use. For more detailed and technical information please see our{' '}

          </p>
          <p>
            As effective as modern security practices are, no physical or electronic security system
            is entirely secure. The transmission of information via the internet is also not
            completely secure. We cannot guarantee the complete security of our databases, nor can
            we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted
            to us over the Internet. We will continue to revise policies and implement additional
            security features as new technologies become available.

          <p>
            Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the
            security of your personal data transmitted to us. Any transmission of data is at your
            own risk. Once we receive your personal data, we use appropriate security measures to
            seek to prevent unauthorised access.
